# `cryptography.hpp`

This file defines utilities in `Cryptography` namespace. Most of them are cryptographic primitives.

## `AgentFlag` enumeration

The namespace should be considered as an enumeration type. The `Type` type is an alias of `unsigned`, which holds the enumeration value. The enumeration is *flagged*, i.e., each bit implies the presence of an agent. `Alice`, `Bob` and `Random` occupy the most insignificant, the second most insignificant and the 18-th most insignificant bit, respectively.

## `Z<p, TBaseType, TPromotedType>` structure template

Represents the quotient ring of Z modulo the ideal generated by `p`. It is often the case that `p` is a prime number, but such requirement is not necessary to instantiate the template. `TBaseType` is an optional argument that allows you to specify another underlying type, if not `uint32_t`. `TPromotedType` is a type in which computation will not cause overflow and defaults to `uint64_t`.
